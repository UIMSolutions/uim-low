This library enables the use of caching. Caching can be used to speed up reading of expensive or slow resources by maintaining a second copy of the required data in a faster or tighter storage system. For example, the results of queries or remote web service accesses that do not change frequently can be stored in a cache. Once the data is in the cache, reading data from the cache is much more performant than accessing the remote resource.
